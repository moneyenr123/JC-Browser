# JC-Browser

JC Browser is a lightweight, client‑side web viewer that provides a familiar tabbed interface, URL bar, and navigation controls. It’s designed to make it easy to open embeddable web content inside a single page and to be hosted on GitHub Pages or similar static hosts. This alows you to watch things like Tiktok, play games and even play Roblox and Clash Royale at school.
